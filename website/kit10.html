<p align="center">Catastrophe is a brand new game that puts you in the shoes of a person with the hardest, most "awwwww" inspiring job in the world:</p>
<h3 align="center">HERDING KITTENS!</h3>
<p>You are in charge of a basket full of adorable kittens, and they're trying to escape! You know they'll be grouchy if they don't get back to their basket, so it's your job to send them back home.
</p>
<p>
You've got a couple of ways to send the kitties back home: you can pick them them up and drop them back home, or you can slide them back into the soft comfort of their basket. Sending the cats back with style will earn you loads of points! Try using a powerup to earn yourself a huge point multiplier!</p>

<p>
You have a limited amount of time, so try to score your points quickly. But be warned; the difficulty of the game scales over time. Be careful not to let the cats escape if you don't want the game to end early!
